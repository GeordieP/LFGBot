# Player Kick Sequence

[ðŸ”™ Back to index README](../README.md#diagrams)

> [!NOTE] 
> This diagram illustrates how we can use Discord message components to kick a player from a group. 
> 
> We create a 'kick player' menu component only visible to the group leader, have them select a user to kick, then bind that user's ID to a new 'kick confirmation' button component. Once the confirmation button is clicked, we perform the operation and clean up the components and message.
