###### LFG = "Looking For Group" or "Looking For Game"

> A Discord bot for organizing in-house 5v5 matches of Counter-Strike, Valorant, Overwatch, etc

One user starts a group, and 9 other users click the "join" button to be placed on a team.

Teams are shown in the bot's message, and can be shuffled by the group leader.

## Dev & Contributing

Open for contributions! The bot is written in [elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) and uses the [Nostrum](https://github.com/Kraigie/nostrum) library to interact with Discord.

    Things you'll need in order to contribute:
  </summary>

- Elixir
  - [https://elixir-lang.org](https://elixir-lang.org)
  - I'm using version 1.15 with Erlang/OTP 26
- A Postgres database
  - [https://www.postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org)
  - If you have docker, there's a `docker-compose` file in this repository which will run a dev database for you. Find it at [lfg_bot_pgsql/docker-compose.yml](lfg_bot_pgsql/docker-compose.yml)
- A Discord developer app for testing your changes locally
  - Learn about app development [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started)
  - Create an app [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications?new_application=true)
- An environment variable on your system called `LFG_NOSTRUM_TOKEN`
  - Once you've made an app in the Discord developer portal (see section above), you can get your token from the settings page in the "Bot" section, under the "Build-A-Bot" header.
  - Copy the token and set yourself an environment variable named `LFG_NOSTRUM_TOKEN`
  - Keep your token secret!
- A Discord server for testing your changes
  - It's recommended to use a personal server for this, just in case
  - Once you've made an app in the Discord developer portal (see section above), you can add that bot to your server by:
    - Getting your client ID from `OAuth2` section
    - Substituting your client ID in this URL: `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE>&permissions=53687158848&scope=bot`
      - (Permissions code last updated Oct 26 2023 // [permissions calculator](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html#53687158848))
    - Opening that URL in your browser

Unless I've missed something, after all this, you should be able to run the elixir application and interact with the bot in your testing server.
